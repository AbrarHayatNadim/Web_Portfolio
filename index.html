            The Microsoft .NET Framework is one of the most common languages used to build various RPA platforms. Even though many RPA platforms offer low-code functionalities, an RPA developer is expected to know Visual Basic .NET programming language to process the entirety of data types using Microsoft’s library of prebuilt methods. Therefore, one of the highly desirable RPA skills is the knowledge of Visual Basic for Applications, a language that allows task automation within Excel and other Microsoft Office applications.Another coding language that RPA developers should know is SQL. That’s because data SQL is important for database integration, which is routine in RPA. Other programming languages that are good to have to include HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript.
